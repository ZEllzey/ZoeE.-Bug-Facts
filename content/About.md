My Name is Zoe Ellzey. I grew up near Austin Texas with my three sisters. My twin and I are the oldest of our sisters, _I am the younger of us two_. I am engaged  and hoping to get married in October 2027. I love all things nature, and recently I have found that is especially bugs.

I have been fascinated with moths, butterflies, and all [[index |insects]] and plan to fill this with information regarding many species, breeds, and information about the diversity of our planets smallest creatures.
