## Suborder *Symphyta*

This order of *Hymenoptera* are considered the most primitive, partially due to their lack of complex social behavior that can be observed in the other orders. They are a widespread category with approximately 10,000 species. Their common name (Sawflies) refers to their ovipositor, which has an appearance like a sawblade. Many species are considered to be pests, as they bore into wood or defoliating plants.

Also referred to as Wood Wasps, they can use their ovipositors to drill into timber, as they are extremely sturdy. Adults look rather like flying ants though they lack the narrow waists like most *Hymenopterans*. Unlike the other families in this order, their larvae look more like caterpillars in appearance, and are often a shade of green. Adults do not tend to live longer than two weeks. Their diets consist of many different foods including plants, foliage, fruits, nectar, and some are even carnivorous. ![[Sawfly - Wikipedia.pdf]]
