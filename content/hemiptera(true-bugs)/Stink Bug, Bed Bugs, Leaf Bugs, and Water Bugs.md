## Suborder *Heteroptera*

This is the largest suborder among [[hemiptera(true-bugs)/index|true bugs]] and contains many common names. There are over 50,000 species in this order including pond skaters, stink bugs, and bed bugs. The name *Heteroptera* means "different wings" which describes the characteristic of these bugs having wing that are half opaque and thickened and the other half membranous and translucent. Many of these species have lost their wings or they are inefficient and can not fly.  The shield bugs are a member of this order and are considered spectacular due to their iridescent and metallic colors. Almost all species have scent glands in the thorax that produce an smelly defensive secretion when they are disturbed.
