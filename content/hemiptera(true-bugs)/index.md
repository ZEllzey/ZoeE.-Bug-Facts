## Related Categories

The category of "True Bugs" is actually fairly limited and many insects you would think of when referring to "bugs" are actually considered [[coleoptera(beetles)/index|"Beetles"]] due to the limited definition of a "Bug".

All insects in the order Hemiptera have mouth parts that are a modified proboscis and have a beak like appearance. The mouth is designed to stab or pierce the host, either plant or animal, and suck liquid in. This order is also characterized by their wings that are hard near the base but soft and membranous near the tips. 

The name Hemiptera comes from the Greek words meaning "half wing", referring to this feature of their wings. This order also contains many species with organs that produce sounds, for example cicadas, though this is not the same as [[Moths]] as they produce a ultrasound sound.
